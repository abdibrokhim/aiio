This is a multiplayer game, so you can play with your friends.

The first person to join is the super user. They can generate images and audio and ask questions to the other users (basic users).

Basic users can see the image and listen to the audio. They can answer the questions.

They will earn points for each correct answer, from 1 to 10 points.

The end.

This is a simple yet fun game. Enjoy it!

I was inspired by a real game I played with my family when I was a child. They made sounds, and I had to guess what they were. They showed me images, and I had to guess what they were. So, I created this game to remember those old days.

Now itâ€™s a multiplayer game. You can play with friends online from all over the world.

Enjoy it!

Thank you!
